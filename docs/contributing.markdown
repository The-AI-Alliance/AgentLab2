Notice that every page on this website has an _Edit this page on GitHub_ link to the corresponding location for the page in the GitHub repo, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source, make edits, and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make other small improvements.

This documentation is built with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="github-pages"}, which uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll){:target="gh-jekyll"} to serve the website. We use the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/){:target="just-the-docs"} Jekyll theme.
